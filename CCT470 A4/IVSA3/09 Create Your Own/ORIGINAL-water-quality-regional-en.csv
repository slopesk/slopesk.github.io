"Note: For the regional indicator, water quality was assessed at 194 sites across Canada using the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment's water quality index (www.ccme.ca/en/resources/canadian_environmental_quality_guidelines/calculators.html). Compared to the national indicator, the Regional water quality in Canadian rivers indicator uses 19 additional monitoring sites to improve the coverage of the northern portions of the Mackenzie River and Pacific Ocean regions. Percentages may not add up to 100 due to rounding.",,,,,,,,,,
